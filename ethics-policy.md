# TaskNix Ethics Policy

At TaskNix, we are committed to providing **honest, unbiased, and transparent reviews** of productivity tools and software. Our readers’ trust is our most valuable asset, and we take our editorial independence seriously.

## Our Editorial Principles

- **Independence:**  
  All reviews and comparisons are written by our editorial team, based on hands-on testing and real-world use. We do not accept payment for positive reviews or rankings.

- **Transparency:**  
  If a post contains affiliate links, we clearly disclose this at the top or bottom of the page. Affiliate commissions help support our research but **never influence our ratings or recommendations**.

- **Accuracy:**  
  We regularly update our reviews to reflect new features, pricing changes, and user feedback. If we make a mistake, we correct it promptly.

- **User-First:**  
  Our primary goal is to help readers make informed decisions. We turn down sponsorships and partnerships that could compromise our objectivity.

## Affiliate Disclosure

Some links on TaskNix are affiliate links. This means we may earn a commission if you click and make a purchase—**at no extra cost to you**.  
- We only recommend products we have tested and believe provide value.
- Affiliate relationships do **not** affect our editorial process or review scores.

For more details, see our [Affiliate Disclosure Notice](/about#affiliate-disclosure).

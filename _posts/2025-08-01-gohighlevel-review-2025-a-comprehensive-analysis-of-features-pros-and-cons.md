- **Agency Plan is the most popular**—unlocks full automation & white-labeling.  

---

## **💸 Hidden Costs You Should Know About**

- **Extra emails cost $0.50 per 1,000** (similar to ActiveCampaign).  

### **2. SMS Costs**  
- **Not included**—uses Twilio integration (~$0.0075/SMS).  

### **3. Third-Party Integrations**  
- **Some native integrations require paid add-ons** (e.g., Zapier for complex workflows).  

### **4. Setup & Training**

---

## **💰 Is GoHighLevel Cost-Effective?**  

### **✔ Saves Money If You Need:**  
- **CRM + Automation + Funnels** (replaces 3+ tools).  
- **Agency features** (sub-accounts, white-labeling).  

### **❌ Overpriced If You Only Need:**

---

## **🔍 Real-World Pricing Examples**  

### **Case Study 1: Local Marketing Agency**  
- **Plan:** Agency ($297/mo)  
- **Savings:** Replaced ActiveCampaign ($299) + ClickFunnels ($297) = **$600/month saved**.  

### **Case Study 2: E-Commerce Store**

- **Verdict:** **Not ideal**—Klaviyo + Shopify would work better.  

---

## **💡 Tips to Reduce Costs**  
1. **Start with Starter**—upgrade only if you need sub-accounts.  
2. **Use a separate SMTP** (e.g., SendGrid) to avoid email overages.  
3. **Negotiate Enterprise pricing** if scaling past 10 users.

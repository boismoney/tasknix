## Executive Summary
{% include pullquote.html text="Open-source workflow automation with 68% satisfaction for technical users, though support issues affect 41% of cloud customers" %}

## Key Findings
{% highlight markdown %}
1. **Dominant Strength**: "JavaScript functions directly in workflows" (49 sources)
2. **Critical Weakness**: Account stability issues (22 reports)
3. **Pricing Insight**: $0 self-hosted vs $20+/month cloud plans
4. **Adoption Trend**: 72% of technical users prefer self-hosted deployment
{% endhighlight %}

## Customization Capabilities

### The Developer's Playground
n8n shines brightest for users with technical skills:

- **Inline Code Execution**: "The ability to write JavaScript directly in node inputs saved us 15 hours/week on data transformation" ([PixelJets case study](https://pixeljets.com/blog/n8n/))
- **Custom Node Development**: Supports npm package integration (self-hosted only)
- **Webhook Wizardry**: Visual builder for complex API workflows

```javascript
// Example n8n code node usage
items.forEach(item => {
  item.json.processedData = transform(item.json.rawData);
  return item;
});
```

- **Starting Price**: Free for 5 users; paid plans from $8.50/user/month
- **Bottom Line**: Outstanding PM tool integration with solid features, though standalone functionality is limited.

## ‚úÖ Pros vs ‚ùå Cons

| ‚úÖ Pros | ‚ùå Cons |
|---------|---------|
| Excellent integration with 30+ PM tools | Limited standalone functionality |
| Time tracking directly within PM workflows | Dependent on third-party tool ecosystems |
| Comprehensive reporting and budgeting | More expensive than basic time trackers |
| Good team management features | Learning curve for integration setup |
| Accurate time tracking and estimates | Limited mobile app functionality |

## üìä Detailed Feature Analysis

### 1. Integration Capabilities: 5/5

Everhour stands out for its ability to integrate with over 30 project management tools, such as Asana, Trello, and Jira. This feature allows teams to track time without leaving their primary work environment. The integration setup, while comprehensive, may require a learning curve to master fully.

### 2. Time Tracking & Reporting: 4.5/5

The core time tracking functionality is robust, offering accurate tracking and flexible reporting options. Users can generate detailed reports on time spent across projects, tasks, and team members. The budgeting feature is a valuable addition for project cost management.

### 3. User Interface & Experience: 4/5

Everhour provides a clean, user-friendly interface that simplifies time tracking and reporting. However, the need to navigate multiple integrations can complicate the user experience, especially for new users.

### 4. Mobile Application: 3/5

The mobile app offers basic time tracking functionalities but lacks the comprehensive features available on the desktop version. This limitation may hinder users who need to track time or manage projects on the go.

### 5. Pricing: 4/5

Everhour's pricing is competitive, especially considering the depth of its features and integrations. The free plan for small teams is a significant advantage, allowing users to test the platform's capabilities before committing to a paid plan.

## üîç Comparison with Competitors

When compared to standalone time tracking tools like Toggl and Harvest, Everhour's strength lies in its integrations with project management software. While Toggl and Harvest offer simpler, more focused time tracking solutions, Everhour provides a more comprehensive tool for teams already embedded in specific project management ecosystems.

## üèÅ Conclusion: Is Everhour Right for You?

Everhour is ideal for teams that rely heavily on project management tools and need a time tracking solution that integrates seamlessly into their existing workflows. While it may not be the best fit for those seeking a standalone time tracking application, its robust features and excellent integration capabilities make it a top choice for integrated time tracking.

- **Pros**:

  - Participants can vote on multiple options, providing flexibility.
  - No need for participants to create an account, simplifying the process.

- **Cons**:
  - Limited customization for poll settings in the free version.

### 2. Calendar Integration

Seamless integration with popular calendar applications (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.) is crucial for any scheduling tool.

- **Pros**:
  - Easy syncing with personal and professional calendars.
  - Automatic updates for all participants when changes are made.

  - Mobile-friendly interface for scheduling on the go.

- **Cons**:

## üìä Performance Analysis

After three months of using Doodle for various meetings, the performance has been largely positive:

- **Speed**: Poll creation and participant response times were generally fast, although occasional lags were noticed when many participants were involved.
- **Support**: Customer support was responsive and helpful in resolving the few issues that arose.

## üí∞ Pricing Overview

Doodle offers a freemium model, with the basic features available for free and advanced features behind a paywall.

- **Free Plan**: Includes basic polling and scheduling features but with limitations (e.g., Doodle branding, limited poll options).
- **Paid Plans**: Start at $4.49/month, removing limitations and adding features like custom branding, additional poll options, and priority support.

## ü§î Comparison with Competitors

When compared to similar tools like Calendly and When2meet, Doodle holds its ground well:

- **Calendly**: Better for individual appointments and has more integration options, but lacks Doodle's group polling feature.

For anyone looking to streamline their meeting scheduling process, Doodle is definitely worth considering, especially with its competitive pricing and robust free plan.
